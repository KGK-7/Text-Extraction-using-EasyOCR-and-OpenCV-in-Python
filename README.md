# **Text Extraction Using EasyOCR and OpenCV**

## **Overview**
In this project i used OCR and computer vision techniques like tesseract ocr and opencv to extract text from image and convert it into audio using Text to Speech modules( TTS )
In future it can be implemented in a device to assist for virtually challenged person for their uses in identifying building names , bus names (destination place ) , identifying road marks etc .

## **Features**
1. **Text Detection**: extracts printed text from images.
2. **Flexible Input**: Provides user-friendly functionality to process images by specifying an image path.

## **Technologies Used**
- **EasyOCR**: A cutting-edge OCR model for text recognition.
- **OpenCV**: An advanced library for image processing and visualization.
- **Python**: The primary language for the project.

## **Setup and Installation**
### **Requirements**
- Python 3.7 or later
- EasyOCR and OpenCV libraries

### **Installation Steps**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jkpraveena/text-from-image.git
   cd text-from-image
   ```

2. Ensure EasyOCR and OpenCV are properly installed:
   ```bash
   pip install easyocr opencv-python
   ```

## **Usage**
1. Place the image you want to process in the project directory or provide its path.
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python appgk.py
   ```
3. View the extracted text displayed in the terminal or stored in a file.

## **Example**
### Input Image:
A sample image containing text.
### Output:
Extracted text displayed as:
```
Extracted Text: "This is an example of extracted content."
```
